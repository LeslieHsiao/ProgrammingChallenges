-- Question 0
SELECT *
FROM public."Marketing"
LIMIT 2;
/* By using limit two, we can get the first two value in the marketing dataset.*/

-- Question 1
SELECT SUM(clicks)
FROM public."Marketing";
/* Using the sum function, we can get the sum of clicks in marketing data set.*/

-- Question 2
SELECT store_location, SUM(revenue) AS sum_per_location
FROM public."Store_revenue"
GROUP BY 1;
/* Group by store and then using sum function, we can get the sum of the revenue 
in store_revenue for each store.*/

-- Question 3
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT *,substring(store_location,15,2) AS geo
FROM public."Store_revenue")
SELECT a.date, a.geo,impressions,clicks,revenue
FROM public."Marketing" a
FULL OUTER JOIN cte 
ON a.date = cte.date AND a.geo = cte.geo
WHERE a.date IS NOT NULL AND a.geo IS NOT NULL;
/* The first step is to take the last two character from store_location, by this
we are able to get all the state in store_revenue data set. In order to have all 
the information in both marketing and store_revenue data sets, I use the full outer
join function which will include all the information in both data sets. To connect
both data set togehter, using on statement will join values in marketing and store_revenue
but since some of the values only exist in only one data set. Some values in our output
will have null values.*/

-- Question 4
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT *, SUBSTRING(store_location,15,2) AS geo
FROM public."Store_revenue"),
CTE2 AS(
SELECT a.date, a.geo, impressions, clicks, revenue
FROM public."Marketing" a
FULL OUTER join cte 
ON a.date = cte.date AND a.geo = cte.geo
WHERE a.geo IS NOT NULL)
SELECT geo, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue, ROUND(avg(revenue),2) AS avg_revenue, SUM(impressions) AS sum_impressions, ROUND(AVG(impressions),2) AS avg_impressions, SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks, ROUND(AVG(clicks),2) AS avg_clicks
FROM cte2
GROUP BY geo;
/* The first step is to follow the step we did in question 3, to get the combining dataset.
And the next step is to find the most efficient store, I use both sum function and 
average function, the reason why I am using these two functions is because the first
function will help us to find the store that have the most revenue and the second function
will help us to find the store that produce most revenue in average.*/
/* I think that CA store is the most efficient store since it produces the most total revenue,
having the highest clicks along with the highest impressions. Having the highest revenue
indicates that the store are generating the most revenue and the highest impressions
indicates that the store are having good impressions from their customers, along with the
most clicks also shows that CA store produces the most clicks. The reason why I do not
think MN is the most efficient store is because it does not have any revenue. Even though
it has higher impressions and higher clicks than CA. But if a store does not produces
sufficent enough revenue, the store cannot be dedine as a efficient store.*/

-- Question 5
SELECT store_location, SUM(revenue) AS total
FROM public."Store_revenue"
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;
/* To find the top 10 revenue producing states, I first group by our data set based on
the store location, and then using sum function can help us to find the overall revenue
for each state. Since we only want the top 10 states the generate the most revenue, I first
order by the toal revenue in descending order and I set the limit to be two, which will only 
show the top 10 stores in our final output.*/
